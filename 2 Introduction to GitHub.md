## Commits

Files are **Untracked** (git is unaware of it) or **Tracked** (git is aware of it).

Tracked files can be:

> **Unmodified**: The file is tracked, but it hasn't been modified since the last commit.
>
> **Modified**: The file has been changed since the last commit, but these changes aren't yet staged for the next commit.
>
> **Staged**: The file has been modified, and the changes have been added to the staging area (also known as the index). These changes are ready to be committed.
>
> **Committed**: The file is in the repository's database. It represents the latest committed version of the file.

## Exercise

Feedback:

- Screenshots are a little out of date, but not confusingly so.
- Waiting 20-30 seconds between performing action and receiving feedback is not ideal, although I do understand wanting to use GH Actions for it.
