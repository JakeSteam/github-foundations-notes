## Account types

- **Personal (aka user)**: Can own resources, uses GitHub Free or GitHub Pro.
- **Organization**: Can also own resources, but can't directly sign in, instead personal accounts have permissions to perform actions.
- **Enterprise**: Account to allow admins to centrally manage billing etc for multiple organizations. Shared accounts(?).

## Plans

- **GitHub Free**: Unlimited private & public repos, 2000 GitHub Actions minutes per month, dependabot, 2FA, etc. Also available for organizations, where it includes team access controls (for the org, obviously).
- **GitHub Pro**: Same as Free, plus 1000 extra GitHub Actions minutes, and similar increases for other limits. Also has access to advanced features in _private_ repos: Required / multiple PR reviewers, protected branches, autolinked references, GitHub pages, wikis, repository insight graphs.
- **GitHub Team**: Almost identical to Pro, but for organizations.
- **GitHub Enterprise**: Same as Team, plus extra GitHub support, security controls, compliance, SSO, etc.
  - Can be provided as GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) or Cloud (GHEC), where GHES is self-hosted. GHEC includes drastically higher limits (e.g. 50,000 GitHub Actions minutes!), SLA, and user management features.

## Accessing GitHub

As well as the website, there are mobile & desktop apps. The mobile app can edit files, review PRs, receive notifications, browse code, use Copilot etc, whilst the desktop app can mostly just manage files (clone repos, check out branches, view CI).

## Billing

- **Subscriptions**: GitHub Pro / Copilot or any apps you're paying for.
- **Usage-based billing**: Typically from going over limits, e.g. GitHub Actions minutes.
