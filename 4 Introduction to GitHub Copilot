## Overview

According to GitHub, following impacts from GitHub Copilot:

- 46% of new code now written by AI
- 55% faster overall developer productivity
- 74% of developers feeling more focused on satisfying work

## Plans

- **GitHub Copilot Individual**: Code completion, chat, etc.
- **GitHub Copilot Business**: Same as individual.
- **GitHub Copilot Enterprise**: Same as business, plus ability to index an org's codebase for better suggestions, and fine tune private models for code completion.

## Exercise

Guide first walks through getting Copilot running in VS Code, which I've already done! Then it uses this exercise repo, which uses Codespaces and works surprisingly smoothly: https://github.com/skills/copilot-codespaces-vscode
