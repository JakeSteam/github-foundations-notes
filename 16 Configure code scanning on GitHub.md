## What is Code Scanning?

> CodeQL is the code analysis engine GitHub developed to automate security checks. You can analyze your code using CodeQL and display the results as code scanning alerts.

## How can it be set up?

1. Default setup (runs as GitHub action).
2. Advanced setup (uses a customisable [CodeQL action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action/) as a GitHub Action).
3. Via CI, then upload results to GitHub.

Typically it'll trigger on PR & push (default).
