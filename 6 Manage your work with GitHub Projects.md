## Projects vs Projects Classic

Apparently these are 2 different things! I think I used Projects Classic before, since this feature comparison (copied verbatim) shows a lot of features that weren't present:

|                       | **Projects**                                                                                         | **Projects (Classic)**                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tables and Boards** | Boards, Lists, Timeline Layout                                                                       | Boards                                                                                  |
| **Data**              | Sort, rank, and group items by custom fields such as text, number, date, iteration and single select | Columns and Cards                                                                       |
| **Insights**          | Create visuals to help understand your work through historical and current charts with Projects      | Progress bar                                                                            |
| **Automation**        | Use GraphQL API, Actions, and Column presets to manage your Project                                  | Configure Column presets for when issues and pull requests are added, edited, or closed |

Overall not many notes here since I don't anticipate ever using this feature again outside of this training.
