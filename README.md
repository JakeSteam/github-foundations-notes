# GitHub Foundation Certification notes

Miscellaneous notes made during study for the [GitHub Foundations Certification](https://education.github.com/experiences/foundations_certificate).

This is [free for students](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/138834), and there [is a study guide available](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/collections/o1njfe825p602p).

## Notes on notes

1. I typically only note things that aren't immediately clear / obvious, or that I might forget. The training has a lot more information.
2. I've been a software engineer for 10 years, so I won't have many notes on the basics of raising PRs / issues (hopefully!).
3. Each file is a "module" in the collection.
