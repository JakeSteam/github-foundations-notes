# GitHub Foundation Certification notes

Miscellaneous notes made during study for the [GitHub Foundations Certification](https://education.github.com/experiences/foundations_certificate).

This is [free for students](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/138834), and there [is a study guide available](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/collections/o1njfe825p602p).

## Notes on notes

1. I typically only note things that I suspect I'll forget, or that don't make sense immediately. As such, my notes are only a small subset of the course's full content.
2. Each file is a "module" in the collection.
